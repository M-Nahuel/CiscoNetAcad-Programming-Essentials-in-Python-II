# Display LED

This is a program which is able to simulate the work of a seven-display device, although using single LEDs instead of segments.

Each digit is constructed from 13 LEDs (some lit, some dark, of course) - that's how we imagine it:

    # ### ### # # ### ### ### ### ### ###  
    #   #   # # # #   #     # # # # # # #  
    # ### ### ### ### ###   # ### ### # #  
    # #     #   #   # # #   # # #   # # #  
    # ### ###   # ### ###   # ### ### ###

> Note: the number 8 shows all the LED lights on.
